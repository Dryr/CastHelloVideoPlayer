# Cast-Simple-Receiver

This shows a very simple receiver to help you get code up and running. You can
think of this as your first step. It is not compatible with our UX guidelines.
It is useful for learning the basic concepts of the system.

## Dependencies
* None

## Setup Instructions
* Get a Chromecast device
* Upload the receiver.html to a website that can be accessed from your Chromecast. Later, when you publish your application, you will need to host so that it is accessible using HTTPS.
* Register an application on the Developers Console (http://cast.google.com/publish). Enter the URL for your receiver application. DON'T PUBLISH YOUR APP.
* If you haven't already done so, please register the serial # of your Chromecast device in the developer console as well.
* Using the Chromecast setup application, make sure [x] send your serial number to Google is checked.  This is the only way that you can access your unpublished receiver.  While your in the Setup application, make a note of the IP address of your Chromecast. It will be helpful later if you wish to use the Chrome Remote Debugger.
* 15 minutes after you have updated the developers console, you should reboot your Chromecast, so that it picks up the changes.
* Enter the App ID of your receiver application into your sender application or one of our sample sender applications, such as DemoCastPlayer.
* You should now be able to launch your receiver using a sender.
* If you wish to watch whats going on, using a Chrome browser, connect to &lt;ip of your Chromecast>:9222 and debug your receiver.  A good place to start is looking at the console log.
